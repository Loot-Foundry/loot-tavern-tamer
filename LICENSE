Alright folks, legalese is intimidating. This first bit is
plain English. All characters, items, creatures, and spells
in this publication are original creations of Plane Shift
Press (a.k.a. PSP) or Loot Tavern Publishing (a.k.a. LTP).
Please don’t replicate or distribute this unless it is a direct
link to where we host it (this is our livelihood!). All
spells, items, and monsters are designated product identi-
ty and are not open content. That includes proper nouns
including, but not limited to: “L’Arsene”, “Loot Tavern”,
“Amalgamooze” etc., as well as spells, magic items, and
player options.
