Creating a physical trap takes 1 hour (which can be done during a short or long rest) and uses trap-making materials (valued in gp) specified in the trap’s description. After a physical trap activates, its materials are consumed and the trap can’t be used again. However, over the course of 10 minutes, you can salvage half the trap-making materials used in the physical trap’s construction if it hasn’t activated yet.</p><p><strong>Magical Traps</strong>. Immediately after you finish a long rest, you can create magical traps—up to a number equal to your Wisdom modifier (minimum 1)—choosing from the options in the Ranger Traps section. Some of these traps require you to expend spell slots in their creation. When you finish a long rest, all undeployed magical traps lose their effects.</p><p>While a physical trap’s description specifies how it is activated, you have flexibility in activating your magical traps. When you deploy a magical trap, you can choose a size of creature and a distance of up to 30 feet. When a creature of that size or larger comes within the specified distance, the trap activates. As another option, you can intentionally activate a magical trap within 150 feet of you using a bonus action or a reaction (with no specific trigger).</p><p><strong>Deploying a Trap</strong>. As an action, you can throw a trap you have created to an unoccupied space you can see on the ground within 30 feet of you, where it arms itself at the start of your next turn. A trap deployed in this way is plainly visible to all creatures. Over the course of 1 minute, you can conceal a trap. A concealed trap can be noticed by a creature that uses its action to make a Wisdom (Perception) check against your ranger save DC and succeeds.</p><p><strong>Disarming a Trap</strong>. Attempting to move an armed trap causes it to activate, unleashing its effects. A creature within reach of a trap can use its action to make a Dexterity (thieves’ tools) check (for physical traps) or a spellcasting ability (Arcana) check (for magical traps) against your ranger save DC. On a success, the trap is disarmed. On a failure, the trap activates and the creature has disadvantage on any saving throw it makes to resist the trap’s effects. As an action, you can remotely disarm one of your traps that is within 150 feet of you.</p><p><strong>Trap Effects</strong>. Spell effects created by a trap don’t require concentration. When a trap calls for a saving throw, the DC equals your ranger spell save DC. You can have multiple traps deployed, but any attempt to deploy a magical trap whose centre is within 40 feet of the centre of another magical trap fails. Creatures with truesight or that are under the influence of the detect magic spell can notice a magical trap’s presence, even if it has been concealed.</p><blockquote><p>Trap-Making Materials</p><p>1 gp worth of trap-making materials weighs 1 lb.</p></blockquote>","chat":"","unidentified":""},"source":"Loot Tavern","activation":{"type":"","cost":null,"condition":""},"duration":{"value":"","units":""},"cover":null,"crewed":false,"target":{"value":null,"width":null,"units":"","type":""},"range":{"value":null,"long":null,"units":""},"uses":{"value":null,"max":"","per":null,"recovery":""},"consume":{"type":"","target":null,"amount":null},"ability":null,"actionType":"","attackBonus":"","chatFlavor":"","critical":{"threshold":null,"damage":""},"damage":{"parts":[],"versatile":""},"formula":"","save":{"ability":"","dc":null,"scaling":"spell"},"type":{"value":"class","subtype":""},"requirements":"Ranager 3","recharge":{"value":null,"charged":false}},"effects":[],"ownership":{"default":0,"PVTW7w8vdWzQovjH":3},"flags":{"core":{"sourceId":"Item.WPSnO5FDjik2VPzD"}},"_stats":{"systemId":"dnd5e","systemVersion":"2.3.1","coreVersion":"10.312","createdTime":1696985061926,"modifiedTime":1696990334471,"lastModifiedBy":"PVTW7w8vdWzQovjH"},"folder":null,"sort":0,"_id":"7togs3rftyzj4doX"}

When a Large or smaller creature enters the trapped area, the trap activates and the creature must succeed on a Dexterity saving throw or take 2d8 piercing damage, and its speed becomes 0 feet unless it’s immune to being grappled. A creature can use its action to make a Strength (Athletics) check against your ranger save DC, freeing the trapped creature on a success.</p><h3>Tanglevine</h3><p><em>3rd-level ranger; magical; 1st-level spell slot</em></p><p>When activated, twisted, knotting roots burst through the ground, creating an effect identical to the entangle spell within a 20-foot-radius circle centred on the trap for the next minute.</p><h3>Snare Trap</h3><p><em>3rd-level ranger; physical; 2 gp of trap-making materials</em></p><p>The bear trap’s non-lethal cousin, the snare trap, tangles a creature’s feet, causing it to fall. You trap a 5-foot square with ropes and vines. When a Large or smaller creature moves into the trapped area, the trap activates and the creature must succeed on a Strength saving throw or be knocked prone, and its speed becomes 0 feet unless it’s immune to being grappled. A creature can use its action to make a Strength (Athletics) check against your ranger save DC, freeing the trapped creature on a success.</p><h3>Solestriker</h3><p><em>3rd-level ranger; magical; 1st-level spell slot</em></p><p>When activated, hard spikes and thorns sprout in a 20-foot-radius circle centred on the trap, creating an effect identical to the spike growth spell for the next minute.</p><h3>Immolation</h3><p><em>5th-level ranger; magical; 2nd-level spell slot</em></p><p>When activated, a 20-foot-radius sphere of flame erupts, centred on the trap. Each creature in the area when the trap detonates must make a Dexterity saving throw, taking 6d6 fire damage on a failure, or half as much damage on a success.</p><h3>Miasma</h3><p><em>5th-level ranger; magical; 2nd-level spell slot</em></p><p>When activated, a 20-foot-radius sphere centred on the trap fills with gas for the next minute or until strong wind disperses it. The gas spreads around corners, lightly obscures the area, and penetrates through creatures’ skin, affecting them even if they hold their breath or don’t need to breathe. When a creature enters the area for the first time on its turn or starts its turn there, it must make a Constitution saving throw. On a failure, a creature takes 3d6 poison damage and becomes poisoned until the start of its next turn. On a success, a creature takes half as much damage and isn’t poisoned. While poisoned in this way, a creature has disadvantage on saving throws it makes to maintain its concentration.</p><h3>Soulbind</h3><p><em>5th-level ranger; magical; 2nd-level spell slot</em></p><p>When activated, there is a flare of brilliant octarine light, and each creature in a 20-foot-radius sphere centred on the trap must succeed on a Charisma saving throw or become soulbound, as per the preserve spell (see page 509). In addition, while a creature is soulbound in this way, it can’t benefit from being invisible. Creatures possessing robust or more powerful essence within their bodies (typically, those of CR 7 or higher) automatically succeed on this saving throw.</p><p>You can expend a spell slot of 4th level or higher when you create this trap instead of a 2nd-level slot. When you do so, creatures with robust or less powerful essence (typically CR 11 or lower) must make the saving throw, while creatures with potent or more powerful essence automatically succeed.</p><h3>Pit Trap</h3><p><em>5th-level ranger; physical; 2 gp of trap-making materials</em></p><p>Because of their nature, pit traps are deployed in the space in which they are created as soon as their construction is finished, and can’t be moved. After the trap activates, you can spend 1 minute recovering it, allowing it to be used again.</p><p>You dig a 7-foot-deep hole in dirt, or another diggable surface, in a 5-foot square. You can choose to fill the pit with sharpened stakes, spikes, or any other sharp materials.</p><p>When a Medium or smaller creature moves into the trapped area, it must make a Dexterity saving throw. On a failure, it falls into the pit, where it lands prone, taking 4d8 piercing damage if the trap is filled with spikes. On a success, it avoids the trap, falling prone in the nearest unoccupied space to the trap. A creature that succeeds on the save by 5 or more doesn’t fall prone.</p><h3>Bewilderment</h3><p><em>9th-level ranger; magical; 3rd-level spell slot</em></p><p>When activated, horrifying illusions abound and psychic energy twists the minds of creatures. Each creature in a 20-foot-radius sphere centred on the trap must make a Wisdom saving throw. On a failure, a creature takes 3d10 psychic damage and becomes affected, as per the confusion spell for the next minute. A creature can repeat the saving throw at the end of each of its turns, ending the effect on itself on a success.</p><h3>Net Trap</h3><p><em>9th-level ranger; physical; 10 gp of trap-making materials;</em></p><p>With a large, concealed net of rope or vines, and an apparatus hidden in branches or a cave’s ceiling, you create a 20-foot square trapped area. Choose a 5-foot square within the trapped area to act as the trigger. When a Small or larger creature enters this square, the trap activates and each creature in the area must succeed on a Dexterity saving throw or be restrained and hoisted 20 feet up into the air (or as high as the canopy/ceiling allows).</p><p>A creature can use its action to make a Strength check against your ranger save DC, freeing itself or another creature within its reach on a success. Dealing 5 slashing damage to the net (AC 10) ends the effect and destroys the net.</p><p>If there is a Huge or larger creature in the trapped area when it triggers, the trap breaks and has no effect.</p><h3>Thunder Charge</h3><p><em>9th-level ranger; magical; 3rd-level spell slot</em></p><p>When activated, a 30-foot-radius sphere centred on the trap erupts with deafening thunder. Each creature in the area must succeed on a Constitution saving throw or take 8d6 thunder damage and be deafened for the next minute. The noise can be heard 2,000 feet away, or even further in echoey locations or underwater.</p><h3>Catapult Trap</h3><p><em>13th-level ranger; physical; 15 gp of trap-making materials</em></p><p>Because of their nature, catapult traps are deployed in the space in which they are created as soon as their construction is finished, and can’t be moved.</p><p>With bent trees, springs, or elastic rope, you create a 20-foot square of tension. Choose a 5-foot square within the trapped area to act as the trigger. When a Small or larger creature enters this square, the trap activates and each creature in the area must make a Dexterity saving throw. On a success, a creature can use its reaction to move up to its speed so that it is no longer in the area. If it’s still in the area, it is affected as if it failed its save. A creature that fails the saving throw is flung 60 feet in a direction you decide when you deploy the trap, landing prone and taking 6d10 bludgeoning damage.</p><p>If there is a Gargantuan creature in the trapped area when it triggers, the trap breaks and has no effect.</p><h3>Infection</h3><p><em>13th-level ranger; magical; 4th-level spell slot</em></p><p>When you create this trap, choose one of the diseases from the contagion spell. When activated, pustulant boils grow and erupt on surfaces in a 20-foot-radius sphere centred on the trap. Each creature in the area must make a Constitution saving throw. On a failure, a creature is affected as if hit by the attack in the contagion spell (using the disease you chose).</p><h3>Snapfrost</h3><p><em>13th-level ranger; magical; 4th-level spell slot</em></p><p>When activated, the area within a 20-foot-radius sphere centred on the trap suddenly drops to a debilitatingly low temperature for the next minute. When a creature enters the area for the first time on its turn or starts its turn there, it must make a Constitution saving throw. On a failure, a creature takes 6d6 cold damage and, until the start of its next turn, its speed is halved and it can’t take reactions. On a success, a creature takes half as much damage and isn’t otherwise affected.</p><h3>Banisher</h3><p><em>17th-level ranger; magical; 5th-level spell slot</em></p><p>When activated, a 10-foot-radius sphere centred on the trap flares into life, attempting to suck all creatures in it into a harmless demiplane. Each creature in the area when the trap activates must succeed on a Charisma saving throw or be transported to the demiplane for the next minute. At the end of this minute, the creature reappears in the space it left, or in the nearest unoccupied space if that space is occupied.</p><h3>Gravity Well</h3><p><em>17th-level ranger; magical; 5th-level spell slot</em></p><p>When activated, gravity begins accumulating in a 30-foot-radius circle centred on the trap. The trapped area becomes difficult terrain until the end of the ranger’s next turn. Each creature in the area when the trap activates must succeed on a Dexterity saving throw or be knocked prone. Furthermore, each creature in the area that is concentrating must make a Constitution saving throw. On a failed save, the creature’s concentration is broken.</p><p>A creature that starts its turn in the area must succeed on a Strength saving throw or take 2d8 force damage and be pulled 15 feet towards the trap’s centre.</p><p>At the end of the ranger’s next turn, the gravity reaches a critical mass and each creature in the area must make a Strength saving throw. On a failure, a creature is knocked prone, pulled to the trap’s centre, and takes 6d8 force damage. On a success, a creature isn’t knocked prone or moved, and takes half as much force damage.</p>","chat":"","unidentified":""},"source":"Loot Tavern","activation":{"type":"","cost":null,"condition":""},"duration":{"value":"","units":""},"cover":null,"crewed":false,"target":{"value":null,"width":null,"units":"","type":""},"range":{"value":null,"long":null,"units":""},"uses":{"value":null,"max":"","per":null,"recovery":""},"consume":{"type":"","target":null,"amount":null},"ability":null,"actionType":"","attackBonus":"","chatFlavor":"","critical":{"threshold":null,"damage":""},"damage":{"parts":[],"versatile":""},"formula":"","save":{"ability":"","dc":null,"scaling":"spell"},"type":{"value":"","subtype":""},"requirements":"","recharge":{"value":null,"charged":false}},"effects":[],"ownership":{"default":0,"PVTW7w8vdWzQovjH":3},"flags":{"core":{"sourceId":"Item.v8AtyNTkddSMfHBc"}},"_stats":{"systemId":"dnd5e","systemVersion":"2.3.1","coreVersion":"10.312","createdTime":1696986751088,"modifiedTime":1696990274273,"lastModifiedBy":"PVTW7w8vdWzQovjH"},"folder":null,"sort":0,"_id":"D4GDEQ80vQCCMOKF"}

As you explore, you will encounter new creatures which you may wish to make your companions. You can tame a Small or smaller creature of CR ½ or lower, as described below. As you gain levels in this class, the size and challenge rating of creatures you can tame increases, as shown in the Tamer Companion Summary table. Vessel. To tame a companion, you must first prepare a vessel using special inks, gems, or other materials.

Preparing the vessel takes 8 hours of work and components with a value in gold pieces equal to at least one hundred times the target creature’s CR.</p><blockquote><h2>Vessels and Cost</h2><p>At 4th level, you can capture creatures of CR 1 and below. To capture a CR ½ or CR 1 creature, you need a vessel worth 50 gp or 100 gp, respectively. If you try to use a vessel worth 50 gp to capture a CR 1 creature, the creature automatically succeeds on its saving throw, and the vessel can be recovered. You can always break down the components of an old vessel to craft a new one as part of the vessel preparation process.</p><p>You can release a companion from a vessel at any point. The vessel remains intact, and can be used to tame a new creature.</p></blockquote><p><strong>Taming a Creature.</strong> As an action, you can throw an empty vessel at a creature you can see within 30 feet of you. The creature must succeed on a <strong>Charisma saving throw</strong> against your <strong>tamer spell save DC</strong> or be trapped within the vessel. A creature automatically succeeds on this saving throw if:</p><ul><li>It is a humanoid, giant, or swarm.</li><li>It is larger than your maximum companion size (use a creature’s unaltered size if it is under the influence of a size-changing magical effect, such as enlarge/reduce).</li><li>It has a higher CR than your maximum companion CR (see the Tamer Companion Summary table).</li><li>It has a higher CR than the vessel can capture.</li><li>It has more than half of its hit points.</li></ul><p>If a creature doesn’t automatically succeed on this saving throw for one of the above reasons, and has either fewer than ten hit points or one-quarter of its hit points, it automatically fails this saving throw. A creature that fails the saving throw is trapped in your vessel and becomes your companion when you next finish a long rest.</p><p><strong>Lost Traits.</strong> When a creature becomes your companion, it loses the following from its stat block:</p><ul><li>The ability to cast any spells (though it retains its spells known, see Psychic Bond).</li><li>Any summoning actions or actions that create additional creatures (such as a wraith’s Create Specter action or an ooze’s Split reaction).</li><li>The Regeneration, Rejuvenation, and Legendary Resistance traits.</li><li>Any effect that restores hit points, unless that effect has a limited number of uses per day.</li><li>Any legendary actions, mythic traits, legendary action options, and mythic action options.</li><li>Any lair actions and regional effects.</li></ul><hr /><blockquote><h2>Optional Rule: Non-Combat Taming</h2><p>If a player impresses a celestial with an especially noble act, or rears a creature from an egg, that creature might be willing to become a tamer’s companion. If so, feel free to ignore the usual rules regarding saving throws on taming, and let the beautiful story of companionship unfold!</p></blockquote><hr /><blockquote><h2>Abilities and Proficiency</h2><p>Abilities and Proficiency As your companions’ ability scores change—often through Companion Improvement Training—their skill modifiers, saving throws, attack modifiers, and saving throw DCs will also change. Working out what ability a creature’s attack or saving throw uses can require a bit of detective work.</p><p>First you have to know the creature’s proficiency bonus (PB). Luckily this is quite easy: it all depends on the creature’s CR and players’ PB. A creatures’ base PB is +2 at CR 0-4 and +3 at CR 5-6. To proceed, subtract the creature’s PB from its modifiers/save DCs. For save DCs, subtract an additional 8 from the DC. Finally, match the remaining values to the ability score modifiers.</p><p><strong>Foundry Note: To set a creature proficiency bonus, you must change their challenge rating on the actor sheet to match your character level. Most creatures from the SRD and other sources are setup to use the correct ability modifier for attack rolls. However in some instances you may need to manually figure out which ability modifier a creature is using.</strong></p></blockquote><hr /><blockquote><h2>Powerful Companion Abilities</h2><p>Some monster features are very powerful, and aren’t designed for use by players. The two most common are recharge actions and gazes. You can help make a companion more balanced by changing these features slightly. It’s advised to approach this on a case-by-case basis, as each feature is different, and some might not require changing.</p><p><strong>Recharge Abilities.</strong> Some creatures’ actions have the addendum “Recharge (5-6)”. This means that after a creature uses that action, it can’t use it again until it has recharged. At the start of the creature’s turn, you roll a d6, and if the result is a 5 or higher, the action recharges. No class has recharge abilities, in part because they add a lot of randomness to the game. Instead of using this recharge mechanic, you can simply change any ability with a recharge to one of the following:</p><h3>Recharge Condition - Companion Recharge</h3><ul><li>Recharge (4-6) - Recharges after 1 minute</li><li>Recharge (5-6) - Recharges after 10 minutes</li><li>Recharge (6) - Recharges on a short or long rest</li></ul><p><strong>Perpetually Active Abilities.</strong> Some traits, like a medusa’s Petrifying Gaze, which is perpetually active and has the power of a 6th level spell, have the potential to become overpowered and repetitive. To balance this, you can add the caveat that “after a creature makes a saving throw against this effect, it is <strong>immune</strong> to the effect for the next <strong>24 hours</strong>”. Work with your GM to find a balanced solution for your game.</p></blockquote>","chat":"","unidentified":""},"source":"Loot Tavern","activation":{"type":"action","cost":1,"condition":""},"duration":{"value":"","units":"perm"},"cover":null,"target":{"value":1,"width":null,"units":"","type":"creature"},"range":{"value":30,"long":null,"units":"ft"},"uses":{"value":null,"max":"","per":"","recovery":""},"consume":{"type":"","target":"","amount":null},"ability":"","actionType":"save","attackBonus":"","chatFlavor":"","critical":{"threshold":null,"damage":""},"damage":{"parts":[],"versatile":""},"formula":"","save":{"ability":"cha","dc":null,"scaling":"spell"},"type":{"value":"class","subtype":""},"requirements":"Tamer 1","recharge":{"value":null,"charged":false}},"effects":[],"ownership":{"default":0,"6EDQhIURNFeiqnOE":3},"flags":{"core":{"sourceId":"Item.cEHiSpm9xwaASXN7"}},"_stats":{"systemId":"dnd5e","systemVersion":"2.1.5","coreVersion":"10.291","createdTime":1691782309961,"modifiedTime":1694182262053,"lastModifiedBy":"6EDQhIURNFeiqnOE"},"folder":null,"sort":0,"_id":"EQvxhLNXsIgB3Npp"}

{"name":"Pocket Familiar","type":"feat","img":"icons/commodities/gems/pearl-water.webp","system":{"description":{"value":"<p>You become bonded to a companion that accompanies you on your adventures and is trained to fight alongside you. Choose a Small or smaller creature with a challenge rating of 1/2 or lower that isn’t a humanoid, giant, or swarm to become your companion. When a creature becomes your companion, it has a maximum number of hit points equal to the average of its Hit Dice, as indicated in its statistics, and it can’t cast spells. Work with your GM to find a companion that suits your campaign world. This companion obeys your commands and is friendly to you and your allies.</p><p><strong>Vessel.</strong> When not summoned, your companion exists inside a magical vessel of your own design, such as a painted animal skull, bejewelled egg, or crystal sphere. While in this vessel, the companion has full cover from all attacks and other effects, is unaffected by area of effects that originate from outside the vessel, and exists in stasis; it doesn’t need to eat, drink, sleep, or breathe, and it is <strong>immune</strong> to poison and disease, although a poison or disease already in its system is suspended, not neutralised. A companion at 0 hit points is instantly stabilised when it enters its vessel.</p><p>If a vessel is broken, or a companion is released from its vessel for any other reason, the creature within it ceases to be a tamer’s companion. It acts according to its own wishes and retains any improvements it gained while a companion.</p><p><strong>Summoning.</strong> As an action, you can summon your companion from a vessel, causing it to appear in an unoccupied space that you can see within <strong>30 feet</strong> of you, or any unoccupied space within <strong>5 feet</strong> of you. You can dismiss a companion within <strong>30 feet</strong> of you as a bonus action or action, drawing it back into its vessel. To summon or dismiss a companion, you must be holding its vessel in hand. You can only have one companion summoned at a time.</p><p><strong>Combat.</strong> In combat, your companion shares your initiative count, but it takes its turn immediately after yours. It can move and use its reaction on its own, but the only action it takes on its turn is the Dodge action, unless you take a bonus action or action on your turn to command it to take different actions. Those actions can be in its statistics or some other action, bonus action, or object interaction. If you are incapacitated, the companion can take any action of its choice, not just Dodge. Your companion can’t take the Multiattack action until you reach 5th level in this class, even if it would otherwise be able to.</p><p><strong>Rest.</strong> A companion gains the benefits of a long rest when its tamer finishes a long rest; if it has at least 1 hit point, it regains all its hit points when you finish a long rest. Unlike other creatures, a companion can’t spend its own Hit Dice to recover hit points at the end of a short rest. See the Soul Bond feature for details on recovering hit points.</p><p><strong>Items.</strong> Armour, barding, and weapons can be equipped to enhance your companion. A companion can wear or carry any equipment that their size and body shape permits. However, your companion must be proficient with the armour or weapon to make full use of it. If your companion wears armour that it lacks proficiency with, it has disadvantage on any ability check, saving throw, or attack roll that involves Strength or Dexterity. A companion that is not proficient with a weapon type does not add its proficiency bonus to attack rolls made with that weapon type.</p><p><strong>Item Bonding.</strong> Over the course of an hour, you can bond a companion to one object that it can wear or carry that is not any sort of container or storage. When a companion is recalled, all items it is wearing or carrying that it is not bonded to are dropped in the space from which it was recalled. A companion can be bonded to up to 3 items at any one time. Companions can’t attune to magic items, unless they have a specific ability that allows them to do so, such as Proto-Attunement.</p><p><strong>Companion Barding.</strong> You can purchase armour for your companion. Any type of armour can be purchased as barding. The cost and weight is doubled for each size category above Medium, and halved for each size category below Small. In addition, the cost is further doubled if the companion is not humanoid in shape.</p><h2>Companion Barding Cost</h2><table><thead><tr><th>Size</th><th>Humanoid Shape Cost</th><th>Abstract Shape Cost</th></tr></thead><tbody style=\"text-align:center\"><tr><td>Tiny</td><td>0.5x</td><td>1x</td></tr><tr><td>Small</td><td>1x</td><td>2x</td></tr><tr><td>Medium</td><td>1x</td><td>2x</td></tr><tr><td>Large</td><td>2x</td><td>4x</td></tr><tr><td>Huge</td><td>4x</td><td>8x</td></tr></tbody></table><blockquote><h2>Home Planes</h2><p>Some magical effects, like the banishment spell, have the ability to permanently banish a creature back to its home plane. When a creature becomes your companion, its home plane becomes the demiplane within its vessel. If the companion becomes permanently banished by such a spell, it simply reappears in this vessel.</p></blockquote><hr /><blockquote><h2>Dominated Companions</h2><p>A companion that is controlled by another creature, such as by the dominate monster spell, can try to resist being recalled into its vessel. When you try to recall such a creature into its vessel, it can make a Charisma saving throw against your tamer spell save DC.
