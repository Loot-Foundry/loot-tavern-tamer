{"name":"Trapper","type":"subclass","img":"icons/environment/traps/trap-jaw-green.webp","system":{"description":{"value":"<p>Through careful preparation, trappers can create both physical and magical traps to ensnare, explode, or enrapture those unlucky enough to find themselves in their vicinity. Trappers are found in all terrains where there are creatures to be hunted. With tact and guile as their companions, a trapper can lay low even the mightiest of prized beasts.</p><h3>Trapper’s Tools</h3><p><em>3rd-level Trapper feature</em></p><p>Having learnt how to create traps, you’ve gained an understanding of how to thwart the traps of others. You gain proficiency with thieves’ tools and you add double your proficiency bonus to any ability check you make using those tools to disarm or manipulate a trap.</p><h3>Trapped Weapons</h3><p><em>3rd-level Trapper feature</em></p><p>When you finish a short or long rest, you can augment one weapon or up to twenty pieces of ammunition that you are holding with a concealed, magical augmentation. You decide whether the augmentation deals acid, cold, fire, or lightning damage. The augmentation lasts until you finish a short or long rest.</p><p>Once per turn, when you hit a target with a weapon attack using the augmented weapon or ammunition, you can activate the concealed augment (no action required). The target of your attack takes 1d8 extra damage of the associated type. At 11th level, you can augment one additional item or up to 20 additional pieces of ammunition when you finish a short or long rest, and the damage increases to 2d8.</p><h3>Set Trap</h3><p><em>3rd-level Trapper feature</em></p><p>At 3rd level, and later at 5th, 9th, 13th, and 17th level, you learn how to make new traps, as detailed on the Trapper Traps table, below.</p><p><strong>Physical Traps</strong>. Creating a physical trap takes 1 hour (which can be done during a short or long rest) and uses trap-making materials (valued in gp) specified in the trap’s description. After a physical trap activates, its materials are consumed and the trap can’t be used again. However, over the course of 10 minutes, you can salvage half the trap-making materials used in the physical trap’s construction if it hasn’t activated yet.</p><p><strong>Magical Traps</strong>. Immediately after you finish a long rest, you can create magical traps—up to a number equal to your Wisdom modifier (minimum 1)—choosing from the options in the Ranger Traps section on page 188. Some of these traps require you to expend spell slots in their creation. When you finish a long rest, all undeployed magical traps lose their effects.</p><p>While a physical trap’s description specifies how it is activated, you have flexibility in activating your magical traps. When you deploy a magical trap, you can choose a size of creature and a distance of up to 30 feet. When a creature of that size or larger comes within the specified distance, the trap activates. As another option, you can intentionally activate a magical trap within 150 feet of you using a bonus action or a reaction (with no specific trigger).</p><h4 id=\"trapper-traps\">Trapper Traps</h4><table><thead><tr><th style=\"text-align:center\">Ranger Level</th><th style=\"text-align:left\">Trap Options</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td style=\"text-align:center\">3rd</td><td style=\"text-align:left\">bear trap, <em>tanglevine</em>, snare trap, <em>solestriker</em></td></tr><tr><td style=\"text-align:center\">5th</td><td style=\"text-align:left\"><em>immolation</em>, <em>miasma</em>, <em>soulbind</em>, pit trap</td></tr><tr><td style=\"text-align:center\">9th</td><td style=\"text-align:left\"><em>bewilderment</em>, net trap, <em>thunder charge</em></td></tr><tr><td style=\"text-align:center\">13th</td><td style=\"text-align:left\">catapult trap, <em>infection</em>, <em>snapfrost</em></td></tr><tr><td style=\"text-align:center\">17th</td><td style=\"text-align:left\"><em>banisher</em>, <em>gravity well</em></td></tr></tbody></table><p><strong>Deploying a Trap</strong>. As an action, you can throw a trap you have created to an unoccupied space you can see on the ground within 30 feet of you, where it arms itself at the start of your next turn. A trap deployed in this way is plainly visible to all creatures. Over the course of 1 minute, you can conceal a trap. A concealed trap can be noticed by a creature that uses its action to make a Wisdom (Perception) check against your ranger save DC and succeeds.</p><p><strong>Disarming a Trap</strong>. Attempting to move an armed trap causes it to activate, unleashing its effects. A creature within reach of a trap can use its action to make a Dexterity (thieves’ tools) check (for physical traps) or a spellcasting ability (Arcana) check (for magical traps) against your ranger save DC. On a success, the trap is disarmed. On a failure, the trap activates and the creature has disadvantage on any saving throw it makes to resist the trap’s effects. As an action, you can remotely disarm one of your traps that is within 150 feet of you.</p><p><strong>Trap Effects</strong>. Spell effects created by a trap don’t require concentration. When a trap calls for a saving throw, the DC equals your ranger spell save DC. You can have multiple traps deployed, but any attempt to deploy a magical trap whose centre is within 40 feet of the centre of another magical trap fails. Creatures with truesight or that are under the influence of the detect magic spell can notice a magical trap’s presence, even if it has been concealed.</p><blockquote><p>Trap-Making Materials</p><p>1 gp worth of trap-making materials weighs 1 lb.</p></blockquote><h3>Tracker</h3><p><em>7th-level Trapper feature</em></p><p>You are an expert at detecting and obscuring tracks. When you make an ability check to find or follow tracks, you can add your proficiency bonus to the result of the check, even if you aren’t proficient in the relevant skill. If you are already proficient in the relevant skill, your proficiency bonus is doubled for that check.</p><h3>Trapper’s Avoidance</h3><p><em>7th-level Trapper feature</em></p><p>The merest hiss of escaping air, depression of a tile, or scent of ozone is all the warning you need to avoid traps’ effects. When you are subjected to a trap’s activation effect that allows you to make a saving throw to take only half damage, you instead take no damage if you succeed on the saving throw, and only half damage if you fail. In addition, if a trap makes an attack roll against you, that attack roll has disadvantage.</p><p>This feature doesn’t function against a trap’s ongoing effects. For example, you can mitigate the effect of a poisonous cloud as it is being released by holding your breath or covering your skin, but on subsequent rounds, the cloud’s saving throw would affect you as normal on a success or failure.</p><h3>Leave No Trace</h3><p><em>11th-level Trapper feature</em></p><p>You’ve learnt to use magic to hide traps, allowing them to be concealed in the heat of battle. When you deploy a trap, you can expend a spell slot of 1st level or higher to disguise the trap with illusion magic, causing it to become invisible the moment it leaves your hands. Creatures don’t see where the trap lands and, if it’s a physical trap, have disadvantage on saving throws made to avoid the trap’s effects.</p><p>In addition, you learn the invisibility spell, which counts as a ranger spell for you, but doesn’t count against the number of ranger spells you know. You can cast it once without using a spell slot, and you regain the ability to cast it in this way when you finish a short or long rest.</p><h3>Booby Trap</h3><p><em>15th-level Trapper feature</em></p><p>You trap your own body against unexpected demise. When you finish a long rest, you can choose one of the following magical effects with which to augment your body until you finish a long rest. After triggering an effect that activates when you are reduced to 0 hit points, that effect can’t trigger again until you finish a long rest.</p><p><strong>Defibrillate</strong>. Once per turn, when a creature hits you with a melee attack, you can trigger an electrical discharge (no action required). The creature is unable to take reactions until the start of its next turn unless it is immune to lightning damage, and you can immediately move up to 10 feet without provoking opportunity attacks. After you move using this feature, you can’t do so again until the start of your next turn.</p><p>When you are reduced to 0 hit points and not killed outright, you can instead drop to 1 hit point and immediately take an extra turn, interrupting the current turn. If you don’t regain any hit points before the end of your next turn, you drop to 0 hit points, fall unconscious, and begin making death saving throws as normal.</p><p><strong>Dissolve</strong>. Once per turn, when a creature within 5 feet of you hits you with a melee attack, you can trigger a spurt of acid to coat its weapon or limb (no action required). If the melee attack was a spell attack or made with a natural weapon, the creature takes 1d6 acid damage. If the result of the attack roll meets your AC and is made with a ferrous, non-magical, non-natural weapon, the acid causes the metal to weaken and the weapon is destroyed.</p><p>When you are reduced to 0 hit points, all your concealed acid charges gush outward. Each creature within 10 feet of you must make a Dexterity saving throw against your ranger spell save DC. On a failed save, a creature takes 10d4 acid damage and an additional 5d4 acid damage at the start of each of its turns for the next minute until it uses an action to wipe itself clean. In addition, on a failure, if the creature rolled a 1 on the d20 for its saving throw and is wearing nonmagical, ferrous armour, the armour seizes. While wearing the armour, the creature’s speed is halved, its AC is reduced by 2, and it has disadvantage on Dexterity saving throws.</p><p><strong>Entomb</strong>. Once per turn, when a creature within 5 feet of you hits you with a melee attack, you can trigger a burst of cold that ripples along the attacker’s limb (no action required). The creature takes 1d4 cold damage and its speed is reduced by 15 feet until the end of its next turn unless it is immune to cold damage.</p><p>When you are reduced to 0 hit points, you become entombed in a block of clear ice that has AC 15, 100 hit points, immunity to cold damage, and vulnerability to fire damage. This icy block lasts for 1 minute or until it is destroyed. While the ice persists, you have total cover against all effects and you don’t make death saving throws. If you regain 1 or more hit points, the icy block melts at the start of your next turn.</p><p><strong>Self-Destruct</strong>. Once per turn, when a creature within 5 feet of you hits you with a melee attack, you can cause a small, shaped charge to detonate (no action required). You take 1 fire damage and the creature takes 1d8 fire damage.</p><p>When you are reduced to 0 hit points, you erupt in an immense ball of fire and immediately fail one death saving throw. Each creature within 20 feet of you must make a Dexterity saving throw against your ranger spell save DC. A creature takes 14d6 fire damage on a failed saving throw, or half as much damage on a successful one.</p>","chat":"","unidentified":""},"source":"Loot Tavern","identifier":"trapper","classIdentifier":"","advancement":[{"_id":"fkKxhF4iaPQFKRZj","type":"ScaleValue","configuration":{"identifier":"","type":"dice","distance":{"units":""},"scale":{"3":{"number":1,"faces":8},"11":{"number":2,"faces":8}}},"value":{},"title":"trapped"},{"_id":"4Zr3HPYzoTWbvXsZ","type":"ItemGrant","configuration":{"items":["Compendium.loot-tavern-tamer.player-features.Fg5vUDCB2ZiLcHlh","Compendium.loot-tavern-tamer.player-features.7l1G8TK7P0DCBv3G","Compendium.loot-tavern-tamer.player-features.7togs3rftyzj4doX","Compendium.loot-tavern-tamer.player-features.D4GDEQ80vQCCMOKF","Compendium.loot-tavern-tamer.player-features.bN2liUPZ060mt71F","Compendium.loot-tavern-tamer.player-features.34TY7R8Xt3azfSGP","Compendium.loot-tavern-tamer.player-features.A02hAbQ68bd1nvTD","Compendium.loot-tavern-tamer.player-features.G14PcM9VbdgIi1oG"],"optional":false,"spell":{"ability":"","preparation":"","uses":{"max":"","per":""}}},"value":{},"level":3,"title":""},{"_id":"efQUK1qHySuA5FfM","type":"ItemGrant","configuration":{"items":["Item.f1SRQj1kvxBlW4Oj","Compendium.loot-tavern-tamer.player-features.6oOAcZcrR9w1ZIMR"],"optional":false,"spell":{"ability":"","preparation":"","uses":{"max":"","per":""}}},"value":{},"level":7,"title":""},{"_id":"t37ZtjZwzcDx1m3Y","type":"ItemGrant","configuration":{"items":["Compendium.loot-tavern-tamer.player-features.SFunSeqZknWngzAN","Compendium.loot-tavern-tamer.player-features.a8flwZY4fcyTQYUS","Compendium.loot-tavern-tamer.player-features.TBMTnOMUVSevoP7s","Compendium.loot-tavern-tamer.player-features.KuouQ8wEd8FgRHdn"],"optional":false,"spell":{"ability":"","preparation":"","uses":{"max":"","per":""}}},"value":{},"level":5,"title":""},{"_id":"pwsHQK6pbQ0ugttC","type":"ItemGrant","configuration":{"items":["Compendium.loot-tavern-tamer.player-features.1tgXg1BPVAwPxfdS","Compendium.loot-tavern-tamer.player-features.4ffUHDs16j7R6zOK","Compendium.loot-tavern-tamer.player-features.xTZNMYIhEgmGDOIO"],"optional":false,"spell":{"ability":"","preparation":"","uses":{"max":"","per":""}}},"value":{},"level":9,"title":""},{"_id":"gxpD0wQPY9y4SN9y","type":"ItemGrant","configuration":{"items":["Compendium.loot-tavern-tamer.player-features.i6nD0Azy5ZoTURzL"],"optional":false,"spell":{"ability":"","preparation":"","uses":{"max":"","per":""}}},"value":{},"level":11,"title":""},{"_id":"rhxFO59yLaSL3hJZ","type":"ItemGrant","configuration":{"items":["Compendium.loot-tavern-tamer.player-features.obv79ifvCGoNvs0v","Compendium.loot-tavern-tamer.player-features.s1V1AdjsyTJa7JgA","Compendium.loot-tavern-tamer.player-features.JPmCztOqhoxIPJDl"],"optional":false,"spell":{"ability":"","preparation":"","uses":{"max":"","per":""}}},"value":{},"level":13,"title":""},{"_id":"fjNShcNCFHituGix","type":"ItemGrant","configuration":{"items":["Compendium.loot-tavern-tamer.player-features.1YdcelBq5EjaXDpJ","Compendium.loot-tavern-tamer.player-features.UNPoUUMaqb1QWg02","Compendium.loot-tavern-tamer.player-features.evvG1fJMbW6V62y7","Compendium.loot-tavern-tamer.player-features.X197LJbfxvduceIC","Compendium.loot-tavern-tamer.player-features.WHA6QGQTUN2LDLmb"],"optional":false,"spell":{"ability":"","preparation":"","uses":{"max":"","per":""}}},"value":{},"level":15,"title":""},{"_id":"hiOGJhv14jZ1Il3Q","type":"ItemGrant","configuration":{"items":["Compendium.loot-tavern-tamer.player-features.aBlQxjwOxJaXz3iQ","Compendium.loot-tavern-tamer.player-features.KEyvaivSI3a983Dr"],"optional":false,"spell":{"ability":"","preparation":"","uses":{"max":"","per":""}}},"value":{},"level":17,"title":""}],"spellcasting":{"progression":"none","ability":""}},"effects":[],"ownership":{"default":0,"PVTW7w8vdWzQovjH":3},"flags":{"core":{"sourceId":"Item.EIKist9fPH8JMhdo"}},"_stats":{"systemId":"dnd5e","systemVersion":"2.3.1","coreVersion":"10.312","createdTime":1696984108614,"modifiedTime":1696990519536,"lastModifiedBy":"PVTW7w8vdWzQovjH"},"folder":null,"sort":0,"_id":"6hGO1m4dIw04LIu6"}

Feel free to corrupt these to fit your parasitic patron! For example, sanctuary might be represented as part of your parasitic symbiont warding the target of your spell from damaging blows. Spirit guardians probably deals necrotic damage, even if you’re not evil, and could manifest as viscous threads of corrupting ichor that whirl around you with a mind of their own. If you’re especially into horror, you could even express dominate person as a part of your patron physically invading your target’s cranium through a nostril!</p></blockquote><h3>Parasitic Weapon</h3><p><em>1st-level Parasite feature</em></p><p>Your patron can manifest on and protrude from your body in the form of a parasitic weapon—claws, teeth, tendrils, or other appendages. As a bonus action, you can manifest this parasitic weapon; you gain a new attack option that you can use when you take the Attack action on your turn. This special attack is a melee spell attack, with a reach equal to five times your proficiency bonus. The attack deals 1d12 bludgeoning, piercing, or slashing damage on a hit (your choice when you manifest the weapon). You don’t add your ability modifier to the damage of the parasitic weapon.</p><p>The parasitic weapon retracts back into your body if you are incapacitated or you use a bonus action to end it.</p><p><strong>Parasitic Flurry</strong>. The number of attacks you can make with your parasitic weapons when you take the Attack action on your turn increases when you reach certain levels in this class, increasing to two attacks at 5th level, three attacks at 11th level, and four attacks at 17th level. If you have another feature that allows you to make multiple attacks as part of the Attack action (such as Extra Attack), making any of those extra attacks each replace one of these parasitic weapon attacks.</p><p><strong>Magical Weapons</strong>. Starting at 6th level, your attacks with your parasitic weapon count as magical for the purpose of overcoming resistance and immunity to nonmagical attacks and damage.</p><blockquote><p>Opportunity Attacks &amp; Parasitic Weapon</p><p>This parasitic weapon can’t be used for opportunity attacks; it specifies that it is only usable when you take the Attack action. Opportunity attacks are made using reactions. Opportunity attacks with a 30-foot-reach weapon would be hard to keep track of!</p></blockquote><h3>Symbiotic Reinforcement</h3><p><em>1st-level Parasite feature</em></p><p>Invested in your survival, your patron manifests in protective ways. You can use your Charisma modifier in place of your Strength modifier when making Strength saving throws. In addition, as a bonus action, you can cause your patron to manifest in your free hand as a shield, with which you are proficient. This shield disappears if you are incapacitated or if you dismiss it as a bonus action. When you reach 10th level in this class, this shield increases your AC by 3 instead of 2.</p><h3>Liquefied Body</h3><p><em>6th-level Parasite feature</em></p><p>As a bonus action, you can transform your body into a viscous, liquid form for 10 minutes. You choose whether your equipment falls to the ground in your space or merges into your new form. For the duration, you can squeeze through a space as narrow as 6 inches wide, and moving through difficult terrain costs you no extra movement. After you use this feature, you can’t do so again until you finish a short or long rest.</p><h3>Birth Parasite</h3><p><em>6th-level Parasite feature</em></p><p>Over the course of 1 minute, you can extrude an independent piece of your patron, causing it to manifest in an unoccupied space within 5 feet of you. This parasite acts as a familiar, as if with the find familiar spell. See this creature’s game statistics in the parasitic ooze stat block (page 215), which uses your proficiency bonus (PB) in several places.</p><p>If you have the Pact of the Chain feature, the parasite counts as a familiar for you for the purpose of applying any benefits from that feature or your invocations.</p><p>After you birth a parasite, you can’t do so again until you finish a short or long rest. If you use this feature while you already have a parasite, the previous one dissolves in a puddle of goo.</p><h3>Transmit Parasite</h3><p><em>10th-level Parasite feature</em></p><p>At 10th level, you learn new ways to use your parasitic ooze to aid your friends or harm your foes. As a bonus action while your parasitic ooze isn’t incapacitated, you can command it to immediately use one of the options below.</p><p><strong>Detonate Ooze</strong>. The ooze moves up to its speed and then explodes, causing it to drop to 0 hit points. Each creature within 10 feet of the ooze must make a Dexterity saving throw against your warlock spell save DC. On a failed save, a creature takes 4d6 necrotic damage and is blinded until the end of your next turn. On a successful save, the creature takes half as much damage and isn’t blinded.</p><p><strong>Symbiote’s Ward</strong>. The ooze moves up to its speed and attaches to the body of a willing creature within 5 feet of it. While attached in this way, the ooze is incapacitated, has a speed of 0 feet, and you can communicate telepathically with the creature it’s attached to, whether or not you share a common language. Whenever the creature the ooze is attached to takes damage, the ooze takes the damage instead.

{"name":"College of Fleshweaving","type":"subclass","img":"icons/skills/wounds/injury-stapled-flesh-tan.webp","system":{"description":{"value":"<p>If leather is a material, then why not skin itself? Students of the College of Fleshweaving make works of art out of weeping wounds, transform disfigurement into displays of transcendent beauty, and mould flesh into innovative adaptations inspired by the flora and fauna around them. A fleshweaver bard down on their luck might find employment as a battlefield surgeon, while the epitome of a fleshweaver’s career is to be the chief facemaker to royalty, altering their visage and physiology through biomantic rituals and deft needlework.</p><h3>Malleable Visage</h3><p><em>3rd-level College of Fleshweaving feature</em></p><p>Years spent mending, shaping, and adapting flesh have given you a preternatural ability to modify your own body. You are proficient with surgeon’s tools, which you can use as a spellcasting focus, and you know the alter self spell, which counts as a bard spell for you, but it doesn’t count against the number of bard spells you know. Over the course of 1 minute, you can cast the spell without expending a spell slot, choosing only the Change Appearance option. When you cast the spell in this way, it doesn’t require concentration.</p><p>In addition, over the course of 10 minutes, you can use your surgeon’s tools to change the appearance of a willing creature. It magically gains the benefits of the Change Appearance effect of the alter self spell, which lasts until it finishes a long rest. After you use your surgeon’s tools in this way, you can’t do so again until you finish a long rest.</p><h3>Suturer</h3><p><em>3rd-level College of Fleshweaving feature</em></p><p>You know the spiritual weapon spell, which is a bard spell for you, but doesn’t count against the number of spells you know. You can cast this spell once without expending a spell slot, and you regain the ability to cast it in this way when you finish a long rest. When you cast it as a bard spell, the weapon takes the form of a giant needle and thread, and deals piercing damage instead of force damage.</p><p>You also learn different ways to use this spiritual weapon. You gain the Suture benefit below, and you gain an additional benefit below when you reach 5th level and 10th level in this class.</p><p><strong>Suture (3rd Level)</strong>. As a bonus action or an action, you can expend one use of your Bardic Inspiration to move the weapon up to 20 feet and grant temporary hit points equal to one roll of your Bardic Inspiration die to one creature within 5 feet of the weapon. If the creature has 0 hit points, you can stabilise it, instead.</p><p><strong>Unspool (5th Level)</strong>. As an action, you can expend one use of your Bardic Inspiration to move the weapon up to 20 feet and force one creature within 5 feet of the weapon to make a Strength saving throw against your bard spell save DC. On a failure, magical threads wrap around the creature, which is restrained for 1 minute. The target can use its action to repeat the saving throw, ending the effect on a success.</p><p><strong>Acupuncture (10th Level)</strong>. As an action, you can expend one use of your Bardic Inspiration to move the weapon up to 20 feet and make a melee spell attack against one creature within 5 feet of it. On a hit, the creature takes piercing damage equal to one roll of your Bardic Inspiration die plus your Charisma modifier, and must make a Constitution saving throw against your bard spell save DC. On a failure, the creature is paralysed until the end of its next turn.</p><h3>Ritual Reskin</h3><p><em>6th-level College of Fleshweaving feature</em></p><p>Over the course of 10 minutes, you can perform a surgical ritual on creatures that you can see within 60 feet of you (including yourself), up to a number equal to your Charisma modifier (minimum of one creature). The creatures gain one of the following adaptations for the next hour. You choose one adaptation to affect all creatures:</p><p><strong>Bull’s Buns</strong>. The target has advantage on Strength checks, and counts as one size larger when determining its carrying capacity and the weight it can push, drag, or lift.</p><p><strong>Cactus Skin</strong>. The target is covered in razor-sharp spikes. At the end of each of the target’s turns, each creature grappling it must make a Constitution saving throw against your bard spell save DC. On a failure, a creature takes piercing damage equal to your Bardic Inspiration die and releases the target from its grapple. On a success, a creature takes half as much damage and doesn’t have to release the target.</p><p><strong>Cat’s Paws</strong>. The target has advantage on Dexterity checks. It also doesn’t take damage from falling 20 feet or less if it isn’t incapacitated.</p><p><strong>Fish Form</strong>. The target can breathe underwater and gains a swimming speed equal to its walking speed.</p><p><strong>Owl’s Sight</strong>. The target has advantage on Wisdom checks and initiative rolls.</p><p><strong>Rhino’s Hide</strong>. The target has advantage on Constitution checks and gains temporary hit points equal to one roll of your Bardic Inspiration die plus you Charisma modifier (minimum 1), which are lost when the effect ends.</p><p>After you use this feature, you can’t do so again until you finish a long rest, unless you expend a spell slot of 3rd level or higher to use this feature again.</p><h3>Soulsew</h3><p><em>14th-level College of Fleshweaving feature</em></p><p>When a creature uses one of your Bardic Inspiration dice, or fails a saving throw against your Suturer feature’s Unspool or Acupuncture effects, it becomes ‘soulsewn’ to you for 1 minute. While soulsewn, an ethereal thread connects you to this creature via a straight line that only you and creatures with truesight can see. This thread breaks if the creature is ever more than 100 feet away from you.</p><p><strong>Spool</strong>. You can use a bonus action to teleport to the nearest unoccupied space of a soulsewn creature of your choice, or attempt to switch places with a soulsewn creature. If the creature is unwilling to switch places, you must succeed on a contested Charisma check against the creature. On a success, or if the creature is willing, you and the target teleport, switching places with one another. If there is not enough space for either of you to switch places, you automatically lose the contest.</p><p>You can teleport using this feature a number of times equal to your Charisma modifier (minimum 1), and you regain all expended uses when you finish a long rest.</p>","chat":"","unidentified":""},"source":"Loot Tavern","identifier":"college-of-fleshweaving","classIdentifier":"bard","advancement":[{"_id":"JbPimNeK9GcVF89y","type":"ItemGrant","configuration":{"items":["Compendium.loot-tavern-tamer.player-features.nxc1dLRq9chqfEnf","Compendium.loot-tavern-tamer.player-features.wVPUAkrE1Z97rXpa","Compendium.loot-tavern-tamer.player-features.2Dm3I4G5ZipMDMpK","Compendium.loot-tavern-tamer.player-features.8oi1zuOA7JJ9fnw6","Compendium.loot-tavern-tamer.player-features.2KTrucPqFJUlZN9m"],"optional":false,"spell":{"ability":"","preparation":"","uses":{"max":"","per":""}}},"value":{},"level":3,"title":""},{"_id":"lSoWarovHegcUlqE","type":"ItemGrant","configuration":{"items":["Compendium.loot-tavern-tamer.player-features.eaFCA4tjaYumUWob"],"optional":false,"spell":{"ability":"","preparation":"","uses":{"max":"","per":""}}},"value":{},"level":5,"title":""},{"_id":"VX4dM3FEP0Jv6jtu","type":"ItemGrant","configuration":{"items":["Compendium.loot-tavern-tamer.player-features.C95zSsrGysEU1szD","Compendium.loot-tavern-tamer.player-features.cqFh01VBbrub7bhV","Compendium.loot-tavern-tamer.player-features.aXHl9wgU1EL8ZSDN","Compendium.loot-tavern-tamer.player-features.plgVWWxvu1yTdsqc","Compendium.loot-tavern-tamer.player-features.qJvHVO3ix9gbA50e","Compendium.loot-tavern-tamer.player-features.DxqoQaeiUDXuat0q","Compendium.loot-tavern-tamer.player-features.PzAll6bYDurynF07"],"optional":false,"spell":{"ability":"","preparation":"","uses":{"max":"","per":""}}},"value":{},"level":6,"title":""},{"_id":"CRCAbHIjcU1ohiO7","type":"ItemGrant","configuration":{"items":["Compendium.loot-tavern-tamer.player-features.AtyDWfn4qQ61EcYv"],"optional":false,"spell":{"ability":"","preparation":"","uses":{"max":"","per":""}}},"value":{},"level":10,"title":""},{"_id":"xZ6QWIE1afFhBCUF","type":"ItemGrant","configuration":{"items":["Compendium.loot-tavern-tamer.player-features.tLcbmBNFz9fYR2vo","Compendium.loot-tavern-tamer.player-features.mL5tWxSpFN6U2QrQ"],"optional":false,"spell":{"ability":"","preparation":"","uses":{"max":"","per":""}}},"value":{},"level":14,"title":""}],"spellcasting":{"progression":"none","ability":""}},"effects":[],"ownership":{"default":0,"PVTW7w8vdWzQovjH":3},"flags":{"core":{"sourceId":"Item.shijDwbv7y5fuMgA"}},"_stats":{"systemId":"dnd5e","systemVersion":"2.3.1","coreVersion":"10.312","createdTime":1696702476649,"modifiedTime":1696783773511,"lastModifiedBy":"PVTW7w8vdWzQovjH"},"folder":null,"sort":0,"_id":"wzgAZhqxMk4wAIpY"}

Often found on aid missions to war-torn lands, such paladins resort to harm only as a means of preventing further suffering. Paladins who swear this oath are more likely than not to heal, feed, and nurture a wounded foe, provided the defeated creature gives its word of honour that it will cease its nefarious activities. They are no fools, however. Typically versed in religion and medicine, these paladins are unlikely to believe the word of creatures inherently inclined to lie, or those that have previously broken their word.</p><h3>Tenets of the Harvest</h3><p>The tenets of the Oath of the Harvest inspire their followers to seek out potential harm and quell it before it blossoms.</p><p><strong>Share Your Meal</strong>. Your powers are a gift to be shared; if someone is in need, you must use your power to meet those needs. To eat your fill while another goes hungry is selfish.</p><p><strong>Nurture Over Cure</strong>. Act in the greatest interest of the many. Find ways to prevent harm before it must be healed.</p><p><strong>Permit Prosperity</strong>. Whether in matters of love, politics, or war, always give your antagonist the opportunity to change and redeem themselves before casting a fatal judgment. A good meal can serve as the backdrop to such events.</p><h3>Oath Tools</h3><p><em>3rd-level Oath of the Harvest feature</em></p><p>Always keen to fortify others with flavourful food, you’ve spent hours slicing, dicing, and cooking.

When you use this bonus action, and at the start of each of its turns for the next minute, the creature gains temporary hit points equal to twice your Charisma modifier (minimum 2).</p><p><strong>Share Vitality</strong>. As a bonus action, you can take any amount of necrotic damage up to your current number of hit points, which can’t be reduced in any way.
